# Short Bio

I am a computer science engineer, holding an engineering degree from [ESI](https://www.esi.dz). I completed my graduation project under the supervision of [Mr Riyadh Baghdadi](https://people.csail.mit.edu/baghdadi/). It focused on using deep reinforcement learning for automatic code optimization in the complier [Tiramisu](https://tiramisu-compiler.org/).


I am currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at [Dauphine PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/), enrolled in the [IASD](https://dauphine.psl.eu/formations/masters/informatique/m2-intelligence-artificielle-systemes-donnees) program. In April, I started my intership at the Lab [SATIE](https://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr/le-laboratoire). Supervised by [Mr Biao Yin](https://pagespro.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/biao-yin) and [Mr Nadir Farhi](https://pagespro.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/nadir-farhi), I am working on platooning optimization on highways using deep reinforcement learning.  

I am interested in:
- Machine learning for image analysis
- Machine learning for 3D scenes understanding
- Reinforcement learning and intelligent decision-making systems
